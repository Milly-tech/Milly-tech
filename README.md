## Hi! 🤗 

I'm Milly, a frontend developer in training based in Panama.

I'm very visual when it comes to developing my projects, and I love for each piece of work to have personality, be easy to use, and look clean.

I'm currently learning technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and in the future I'll learn React and React Native. 

My favorite tools are Figma and Notion for organizing my to-do list.

Fun facts:

• I have a cat 🐱. I love cats, haha.

• I also love good home-cooked food.

Some hobbies, when I'm not coding, include watching TV series, researching different topics that interest me at the moment, and listening to music, which I love and enjoy.
