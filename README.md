## Hi there 👋

I love learning about programming—it's fun, and I love challenges.
I'm very visual when it comes to developing my projects, and I love it when projects have personality, are easy to use, and are comfortable.

I'm currently learning technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and in the future, I'll be learning React and React Native. 

My favorite tools are Figma and Notion for organizing my tasks and to-do lists.

Fun facts:
• I have a cat, and I love cats, haha.
• I love eating good homemade food.
• I am Christian, and I believe in God.
• Hobbies and interests: anime & K-dramas, learning a little bit about everything.
