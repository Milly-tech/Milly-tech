## Hi there! 🤗 

I'm Milly, a frontend developer based in Panama.

I love learning about programming it's fun, and I love challenges. 

I'm very visual when it comes to developing my projects, and I love projects that have personality, are easy to use, and are comfortable.

I'm currently learning technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and in the future, I'll be learning React and React Native. 

My favorite tools are Figma and Notion for organizing my tasks and to-do lists.

Fun facts:

• I have a cat 🐱, and I love cats, haha.

• I love eating good homemade food.

Hobbies and pastimes: watching TV series, learning a little bit about everything, and listening to music.
